# claude-hook-entry.sh — invoked by Claude Code for each configured hook event.
#
# Why a script file instead of an inline shell command in settings.json:
# Cursor Agent also discovers and executes ~/.claude/settings.json hooks.
# When those inline commands emit as --adapter claude-code with a Cursor
# payload, atrium's first-wins session binding mislabels the Cursor pane
# as Claude Code. Centralizing emit here lets us refuse to speak when the
# host is not Claude Code.
#
# Args:
#   $1  atrium event name (kebab-case: session-start, pre-tool-use, ...)
#
# Stdin:
#   JSON payload from the host (may be empty for some events).
#
# Side-effect:
#   Emits an atrium hook event as claude-code — unless this invocation
#   is clearly from Cursor Agent (env and/or payload shape).
