# Subcommands: install, uninstall, status (default: status).
# Output: JSON to stdout, diagnostics to stderr.
#
# atrium takes over the single `statusLine` slot in ~/.claude/settings.json
# so it can relay Claude Code's context/quota state to the composer meter (see
# statusline-relay.sh). Unlike hooks (arrays, marker-stripped),
# `statusLine` is a SINGLE object — so install preserves the user's prior
# command in a sidecar and the relay chains to it, keeping their display.

SUBCOMMAND="${1:-status}"
SETTINGS_FILE="${HOME}/.claude/settings.json"
# Sidecar holding the user's pre-atrium statusLine command, so the relay
# can reproduce their display and uninstall can restore it. Lives next to
# settings.json (shared across atrium instances, which share settings.json).
CHAIN_FILE="${HOME}/.claude/.atrium-statusline-chain"

# Marker embedded as the first statement of the atrium-owned statusLine
# command; install/uninstall/status detect ownership by testing for it.

#
# settings.json is GLOBAL but the relay script lives per-instance-data-dir,
