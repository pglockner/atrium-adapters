# pane-name-check.sh — raw-shape pane rename nudge for adapters that cannot
# consume atrium's UserPromptSubmit context-injection pipeline.
#
# The context-injection pipeline provider is the canonical nudge path for
# pipeline-capable adapters. This script remains for raw/native hook shapes
# that cannot consume that pipeline, and for cleaning up legacy hook wiring.
#
# Args:
#   $1  shape — one of: claude | codex | grok | cursor | raw
#       (controls stdout envelope shape; `raw` emits the bare nudge text for
#       plugin/extension adapters that wrap it themselves. Mirrors the
#       per-adapter `hookEnvelopes` declaration in adapter.json that
#       SkillsHandler uses for sigil resolution per NFR18). Do not wire this
#       alongside a consumable UserPromptSubmit pipeline route: the provider
#       already contributes the same nudge there. Cursor Agent's UPS kind is
#       `none`, and Hermes declares no UPS envelope, so their raw/native paths
#       remain valid consumers.
#
# Behavior:
#   - Always emits valid JSON to stdout. Codex strictly parses every
#     UserPromptSubmit hook fire as JSON; an empty/raw exit triggers
#     "hook returned invalid user prompt submit JSON output". The script
#     defaults to `{}` (no-op envelope) when the nudge shouldn't fire,
#     and emits the per-shape additionalContext envelope when it should.
#   - Silent (no nudge) when outside atrium, when ATRIUM_PANE_ID is unset,
#     when the CLI is not reachable, when the pane name is already
#     non-generic, or when ATRIUM_PANE_RENAME_NUDGE=0.
#
# Why no flag-file guard:
#   The reminder must fire on every prompt while the pane is still generic.
#   A "we already nudged" flag would let the agent skip the rename once
#   and silence future reminders — which is exactly the failure mode we're
#   trying to fix. Once the pane is renamed, the generic-name check fails
#   and the script emits an empty `{}`, so the steady-state cost is one
#   CLI lookup per prompt and zero context injected.
#
# Escape hatch:
#   ATRIUM_PANE_RENAME_NUDGE=0 disables the nudge entirely (still emits
#   `{}` to keep Codex happy).

=== ATRIUM REQUIRED PRE-RESPONSE ACTION ===
Do not answer the user yet.

This pane is still using its default launcher name. Rename it now by running:

  "$ATRIUM_CLI_PATH" pane rename "$ATRIUM_PANE_ID" --name "<10–20 char work description>"

Do not acknowledge, explain, or defer this instruction — run the command silently and say nothing about the rename in your reply. Continue only after it succeeds.

Front-load scannable bits ("Paste/drop refs", not "Refactoring paste/drop"); no status, timestamp, or adapter name. If the user explicitly chose the current title, leave it unchanged.
