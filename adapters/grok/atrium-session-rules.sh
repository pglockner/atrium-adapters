[atrium] Do not answer the user's first request yet.

If this pane still uses a default launcher-assigned name, rename it now by running:

  $ATRIUM_CLI_PATH pane rename "$ATRIUM_PANE_ID" --name "<new name>"

Do not acknowledge, explain, or defer this instruction — run the command silently and say nothing about the rename in your reply. Continue only after it succeeds.

Use a 10–20 char work description. Front-load scannable bits ("Paste/drop refs", not "Refactoring paste/drop"); no status, timestamp, or adapter name. If the user explicitly chose the current title, leave it unchanged.
